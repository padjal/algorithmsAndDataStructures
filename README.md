# Algorithms and data structures

## Code from my algorithms and data structures university course in HSE, Moscow.

## Introduction

As a part of my Bachelor's degree, I am taking an Algorithms and data structures course. I will upload all the related code in this repository.

### Navigating through the code
The code is divided in three self-explanatory folders - Classwork, Homework, and contests. Each week there is a contest, which includes several automatically tested problems in an online platform.

If you have any questions, you can always reach me at pdzhalev@edu.hse.ru.
